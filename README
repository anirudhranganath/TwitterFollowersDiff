Version: 1.0 created May 13 2012 (first version)

Description:
	This is a simple console application based on C# to find out who (un)followed you on twitter. But it could do more!

Motivation: 
	To learn the Twitter API and develop (mostly) production level code by someone who has very little of it. This wasn't intended to be a quick hack.

Future: 
	I do have plan to expand this(into better apps) and would like to keep it in a way where it wouldnt require oauth or private data.

Contributors: 
	As of now, it is only me, but I would love helping hands. Of course, I would like it to go beyond finding twitter follower diff and possibly as a Managed Twitter API if necessary.

Usage License:
	You may not SELL or make proprietary any product or service created using this code, or a reasonably modified version of it without an explicit written permission of the Author.
	You may modify and re-distribute this code(without fee) for educational, hobbyist or research purposes.
	I would appreciate if I was notified of any use in the above form. It might inspire me to write more code for this.

Disclaimer: This code comes as is, without any form of guarantee. 

Namespaces and Classes:
Exceptions:
	Contains Exceptions. Currently only USerNotFoundException exists. We would need more such as RateLimitHitException etc

TwitterClasses:
	Some static Twitter Specific Classes to help Communicate with twitter. 
	We could have classes for profiles, lists, status etc.
	This could serve as the base of the API
	WebIntegration could be moved to this namespace in the future

FileInteraction.cs:
	For saving and reading follower files. 
	Files are saved in the format handle.twFol in the executing folder

WebIntegration.cs:
	Primary Class for integrating with twitter. Currently a static class.
	In the future, this may be moved to the TwitterClasses namespace as a key part of the API.
	
Program.cs:
	The main procedure.
	A followerLimit has been imposed to prevent hitting the rate limit.
	Isn't as well written as the other parts of the code and needs more work, specifically in the diff function.
